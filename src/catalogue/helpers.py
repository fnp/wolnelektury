    Finds tags related to given tags through books, and counts their usage.

    Takes ancestry into account: if a tag is applied to a book, its
    usage on the book's descendants is ignored.

    This is tested for PostgreSQL 9.1+, and might not work elsewhere.
    It particular, it uses raw SQL using WITH clause, which is
    supported in SQLite from v. 3.8.3, and is missing in MySQL.
